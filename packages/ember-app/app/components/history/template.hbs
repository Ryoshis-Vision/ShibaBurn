        This burning portal was created by the team behind

        giving to the <b>SHIBARMY</b>, and <br>adding value to the <b>SHIBA INUVERSE</b>.

        This portal has been built to reward SHIB burners with a passive income in the form of RYOSHI.
        In fact, going forward, 0.49% of all RYOSHI transactions will be distributed to owners of <b>burntSHIB</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But by the might of the <b>GREAT AND POWERFUL SHIBA INU</b>,
        <br>the RYOSHI team has built this portal to be fully flexible and extensible to be used with any and all tokens<br>that offer rewards for burning.
        <br>
        <br>
        In other words, any project can use the ShibaBurn smart contract to create a "BURN pool" to offer rewards for burning any token.

        Long ago ({{commatize ethereum.daysSinceRyoshiLaunch}} days),
        <br>
        several true <b>RYOSHIS</b> came together to form
        a new a project
        <br>
         dedicated to fueling the greatness of <b>$SHIB</b> and <b>SHIBA SWAP</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These <b>RYOSHI WARRIORS</b> stood on the front lines,
        <br/>
        and created what's now known as
        <br/>
        <span class='font-32 '>
          <b>$RYOSHI</b>
          <span class='bright'>(Ryoshis Vision)</span>

        An ERC20 token that gives 1% of EVERY TRANSACTION
        <br/>
        directly to the <b>SHIBA SWAP</b> community.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At this moment in time that values at

        For phase #1 (the first 20 weeks), these rewards were
        <br>
        distributed <b>EQUALLY</b> to every holder of xSHIB
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now, with phase #2 (20 more weeks),
        these rewards
        <br>
        will be given to the <b>RYOSHI WARRIORS</b> 
        that serve
        <br/>
        in the following 3 factions:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        - 45% proportional owners of the

          With these new incentive pools,
