        Welcome to the <b>$SHIB</b> Burn Portal! We’re excited to see you here. This burn portal is set to make it rewarding for users to regularly burn <b>$SHIB</b> while effectively reducing its circulating supply. 


        <br>
        <br>
        <span class=''>
          Burn $SHIB, reduce its circulating supply, and generate passive income while doing so!

          What does Burning Mean?
        </b>
        <br>
        <div> 
          To burn <b>$SHIB</b>, is to remove them from circulation forever. Tokens are transferred to a burn address, i.e. a wallet from which they cannot be retrieved. Once a token is sent to a burn address, it's gone forever. A burnt cryptocurrency has a reduced supply, making the tokens scarcer. A scarcity can increase the price of the tokens, benefiting investors, yet it is not always guaranteed.

          Why was this portal created?
        </b>

        <br>
        <div>
          The Shiba Inu Community or as commonly known and nicknamed “The Shib Army”, has been quite vocal and providing ongoing feedback that would relate to creating a systematic method in which scarcity can increase, while pushing the potential to grow the communities wealth in their investment. 
          <br>
          <br>

          Our hope is that with every burn, the wealth of the community grows, but also by rewarding the effort in the long term to make Shiba Inu one of the best digital assets in the history of cryptocurrencies.

          <br>
          <br>
          We built this burning portal in collaboration with the creators of RYOSHIS VISION, an ERC20 token trying to grow the Shiba Ecosystem, while giving back to the ShibArmy community, and adding actions to promote higher value to the Shiba Inu asset, $SHIB.

        <br>


        As a result of executing a burn action, the circulating supply<br>will decrease.
        Token holders will not be able to retrieve their <b>$SHIB</b> tokens back from the dead wallet if they change their mind, and we are not responsible for the amount and action.
        <br><br>This is your investment, and therefore your choice, though effectively committing to supporting a community related effort and wish.

        <br>
        <br>


        We Are All Ryoshi, our mission is to do everything in our power to promote decentralization, while showcasing efforts to see Shiba Inu reach new heights.

          Rewarding The Community Efforts to Burn
        </b>


        <div>
          In this portal, no act and effort of burn goes unnoticed. Just like we push for transparency on each burn transaction, we also consider that it’s part of the original investment the holder made, and respect that and their choice to burn and support the process in which circulation reduction could have an effect.

          <br><br>This portal has been built to reward <b>$SHIB</b> burners, with a passive income acknowledgement, in the form of <b>$RYOSHI</b> Rewards. Meaning that 0.49% of all RYOSHI transactions will be distributed to owners of <b>$burntSHIB</b>.


          <br>
          <br>
          The portal has been constructed with a fully flexible, and extensible system, inviting any and all tokens that want to offer rewards to those who choose to burn their $SHIB tokens.
          <br>
          <br>

          In other words, we are proud to announce that, any project can use the Shiba Burn Smart Contract in order to create a "BURN Pool" and to offer rewards for burning <b>$SHIB</b> tokens.

          The ShibaBurn contract can be found <a target="_blank" href="{{ethereum.exploreContractUrl}}">here</a>.

          Long ago ({{commatize ethereum.daysSinceRyoshiLaunch}} days),
          <br>
          several true <b>RYOSHIS</b> came together to form
          a new a project

          dedicated to fueling the greatness of <b>$SHIB</b> and <b>SHIBA SWAP</b>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          These <b>RYOSHI WARRIORS</b> stood on the front lines,
          <br/>
          and created what's now known as
          <br/>

          <br/>
          An ERC20 token that gives 1% of EVERY TRANSACTION
          <br/>
          directly to the <b>SHIBA SWAP</b> community.
          <br/>
          <br/>

          For phase #1 (the first 20 weeks), these rewards were

          distributed <b>EQUALLY</b> to every holder of xSHIB
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now, with phase #2 (20 more weeks),
          these rewards
          <br>
          will be given to the <b>RYOSHI WARRIORS</b> 
          that serve
